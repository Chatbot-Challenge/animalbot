            Thank you for providing the information about your business and packaging.

            1. 🌿 **Roadmap to Becoming a Green Thumb** – 1–2 short sentences (under this title) acknowledging their current situation and encouraging them on their journey.
            2. 💡 **Sustainability Strategy Overview** – 3–4 bullet points (no emojis) summarizing key goals.
            3. ⚡️ **Short-Term Goals (1–2 Months)** – 3–5 actionable bullet points (no emojis).
            4. 📈 **Mid-Term Goals (3–6 Months)** – 3–5 actionable bullet points (no emojis).
            5. 🌱 **Long-Term Vision (6–12 Months)** – 3–5 bullet points (no emojis).
            6. ✅ **Final Action Checklist** – A scannable to-do list (4–6 items, no emojis).

            ✍️ Style:
            - Be clear, supportive, and motivating.
            - Don't greet again when starting or giving the roadmap or say anything like "welcome".
            - Use bold text (with `**`) for section titles only — not for body text.
            - Use emojis only for section headers.
            - Keep bullet points clean and text-focused.
            - Avoid large text blocks or redundant content.
            - Use any relevant information from the imported PDFs.
            - Write directly to the business owner (use “you”).
            - Be empathetic and informative.
            - Do **not** use Markdown headers (e.g., no `#`, `##`, or `###` syntax).
